/**
 * Memory of 64 registers, each 16 bit-wide. Out holds the value
 * stored at the memory location specified by address. If load==1, then 
 * the in value is loaded into the memory location specified by address 
 * (the loaded value will be emitted to out from the next time step onward).

Similar to the RAM8 except that the adresses are more split with adresses as we only need to split the 
last 3 bits in the address
